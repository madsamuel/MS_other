This is a proof-of-concept throttling solution on Windows that requires admin privilates.  It uses WinDivert, a kernel driver with Python wrappers, for network packet shaping. This approach hooks into the Windows network stack at a low level, allowing you to capture all inbound/outbound packets, queue them, and release them at a controlled rate. Itâ€™s essentially building a small packet shaper in Python.

Prerequisites: pip install pydivert

How to test: Open a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.) and try downloading a file over HTTP or HTTPS or simply load a news website with lots of images.
