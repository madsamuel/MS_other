Python can display adaptive/interactive toasts on Windows 10/11 much like <a>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/adaptive-interactive-toasts?tabs=appsdk</a>. However, you wonâ€™t find a simple out-of-the-box Python library that fully covers all the advanced features (adaptive layouts, in-line replies, buttons, hero images, etc.) that are demonstrated with C# or WinRT. Instead, you can achieve this by calling the Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs from Python.
