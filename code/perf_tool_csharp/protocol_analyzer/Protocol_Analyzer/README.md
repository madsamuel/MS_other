# Protocol Analyzer - Refactored Architecture

## Overview

This project has been completely refactored to follow SOLID principles and modern software architecture best practices. The application now uses a layered architecture with proper separation of concerns, dependency injection, and maintainable code structure.

## Architecture Overview

### SOLID Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each service class has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - UI controls are specialized for specific data types
   - Models only contain data and property change notifications

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Services are extensible through interfaces
   - New data sources can be added without modifying existing code
   - UI controls can be extended or replaced independently

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - All service implementations can be substituted through their interfaces
   - Polymorphic behavior is maintained throughout the service layer

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Interfaces are focused and don't force implementation of unused methods
   - Each service interface represents a specific domain responsibility

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete classes
   - Dependencies are injected through constructor injection
   - Service container manages object lifetime and dependencies

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Data Access**: Services handle all external data retrieval
- **Business Logic**: ViewModels manage application state and operations
- **UI Logic**: Controls focus only on data presentation
- **Configuration**: Service container manages dependencies

### 2. Testability
- All dependencies are injected through interfaces
- Services can be easily mocked for unit testing
- UI components can be tested independently

### 3. Maintainability
- Clear separation between data, logic, and presentation
- Each class has a single responsibility
- Changes in one layer don't affect others

### 4. Extensibility
- New data sources can be added by implementing interfaces
- UI components can be replaced or extended easily
- Service container allows for easy configuration changes

### 5. Error Handling
- Centralized error handling in services
- Graceful degradation when data sources are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages

## Service Layer Details

### ISystemInformationService
Orchestrates all data collection from various sources and provides a unified API for the UI layer.

### IGpuInformationService
Handles GPU and display information retrieval including resolution, DPI scale, and graphics profile details.

### IDetectedSettingsService
Manages detection of display settings, visual quality, frame rates, and encoding capabilities.

### IRealTimeStatisticsService
Provides real-time performance statistics such as encoder frame drops and input FPS.

### ISessionInfoService
Retrieves RDP session information including session ID, client name, and protocol version.

### ICustomSettingsService
Manages loading and reading of custom registry settings from configuration files.

### ITrayIconService
Handles system tray icon creation, context menu, and lifecycle management.

### IResourceService
Provides centralized resource loading for icons and JSON configuration files.

## MVVM Pattern Implementation

The application uses the Model-View-ViewModel pattern:

- **Models**: Data classes with property change notifications
- **ViewModels**: Business logic and state management
- **Views**: UI controls that bind to ViewModels

## Dependency Injection

The `ServiceContainer` class provides a simple dependency injection container that:
- Registers all services and their dependencies
- Provides service resolution through interfaces
- Manages object lifetimes
- Supports proper disposal of resources

## Error Handling Strategy

- Services catch and log exceptions gracefully
- UI continues to function even when data sources fail
- Default values are provided when real data is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages for critical failures

## Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous data loading prevents UI blocking
- Real-time updates are throttled to prevent excessive resource usage
- Lazy loading of expensive resources
- Proper disposal of resources and event handlers

## Future Enhancements

This architecture supports easy addition of:
- Unit and integration tests
- New data sources
- Additional UI components
- Configuration management
- Logging framework
- Caching mechanisms
- Plugin architecture

## Migration from Legacy Code

The refactoring maintains all original functionality while improving:
- Code organization and readability
- Testability and maintainability
- Error handling and robustness
- Performance and responsiveness
- Extensibility for future features
