# DisplayInfoUtil

DisplayInfoUtil is a Windows console application that retrieves and displays comprehensive information about your primary monitor including resolution, DPI scaling factor, and refresh rate. The application uses Windows API calls to gather accurate display metrics while being DPI-aware to prevent Windows virtualization from affecting the results. Simply run the executable to get a quick overview of your primary display's technical specifications.
